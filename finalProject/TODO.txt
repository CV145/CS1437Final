- add a 0 before day if it is below 10 before adding to transaction number



- format to 2 decimal places




- figure out why date is not displaying fully

- project needs to save between uses and probably have a "factory reset" button
... specifically the transactionNum which keeps setting back to 1 when starting over
factory reset would delete the binary files
